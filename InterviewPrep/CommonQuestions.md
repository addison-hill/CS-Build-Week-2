## Tell me about yourself?

What do you have to offer?” The interviewer wants to hear about your strengths, skills, abilities and experiences - especially related to the job you are interviewing for. Key points to hit: what you did professionally before Lambda School, what skills you have learned and how have you applied them practically in your projects, and how you plan to use these skills to benefit the company you are applying for. Be specific about the projects you’re working on and the skills you’ve gained. (Does this sound like your elevator pitch? It should.)

- The employer wants to see your communication and collaboration skills.
